                <h2>Xbox chief admits Microsoft has ‘a ton of work to do on Windows’ for PC gamers</h2>

                <p>
                    Microsoft’s Windows operating system is the go-to for PC gamers, but some aspects of Windows 10 have fallen short. 
                    One of the biggest criticisms is the Microsoft Store (Windows Store), that offers games and apps in a one-click install. 
                    Microsoft publishes all of its first-party games through the store, and PC gamers are forced to buy these games exclusively from the store.
                    <br><br>
                    Unfortunately, some games come with odd restrictions that you wouldn’t typically see in regular desktop PC games. 
                    These range from not supporting overlays from apps like Fraps or Discord, to no Nvidia Shadowplay support in some titles, and even no sound when you alt-tab out of a game in some Microsoft Store games. 
                    The download and install procedure for Microsoft Store games is often buggy, with failed installs and error codes a particular headache for some PC gamers.

                <h2>Review: Microsoft Surface Laptop 2</h2>

                <p>
                    WHILE THE SURFACE was originally envisioned as a tablet, at some point along the way, Microsoft realized that, you know, what a lot of people actually want is a laptop. 
                    One with a real keyboard that you can type on, not some floppy snap-on device that can’t even be properly used in your lap.
                    <br><br>
                    Enter the creatively-named Surface Laptop, a machine that launched last year with the goal of providing a simple notebook for Everyman, something that its luxe Surface Book, launched two years prior, never really managed to do. 
                    Unlike the Surface Book, the Surface Laptop’s keyboard is permanently attached to its chassis, and frills are in short supply. 
                    With version 2 of this device, you’re getting a down-to-earth laptop that, while quirky at times, serves as a solid, versatile computing device for a wide range of user types.

                <p>  
                    Final update Microsoft's activation servers appear to be on the blink this morning – some Windows 10 users woke up to find their Pro systems have, er, gone Home.
                    <br><br>
                    Twitter user Matt Wadley was one of the first out of the gate, complaining that following an update to the freshly released Insider build of next year's Windows, his machine suddenly thought it had a Windows 10 Home licence.

                <p>
                    Microsoft’s Javier Soltero, the company’s vice president of Cortana, will be departing by the end of the year, according to a report from ZDNet. 
                    Following the report’s publication, Soltero confirmed his departure in a tweet posted to his personal account.
                    <br><br>
                    Soltero first joined Microsoft when it scooped up his email app Acompli back in late 2014. 
                    He and the Acompli team helped Microsoft vastly improve its Outlook iOS app. 
                    He later became the overall head of Outlook before taking on the Cortana chief role in March of this year, as part of the company’s massive reorganization that brought a renewed focus on artificial intelligence and the cloud, as well as the departure of Windows chief Terry Myerson.

                <p> 
                    REDMOND, Wash. — Microsoft said on Friday that it would sell the military and intelligence agencies whatever advanced technologies they needed “to build a strong defense,” just months after Google told the Pentagon it would refuse to provide artificial intelligence products that could build more accurate drones or compete with China for next-generation weapons.
                    <br><br>
                    The announcement — made quietly in a small, town-hall-style meeting with the software giant’s leadership and employees on Thursday, then published on a blog on Friday afternoon — starkly illustrated the radically different paths these leading American technology companies are taking as they struggle with their role in creating a new generation of cyberweapons to help, and perhaps someday replace, American warriors.

                <h2> LENOVO YOGA BOOK C930 REVIEW: TWO SCREENS AND LOTS OF COMPROMISES </h2>

                <p> 
                    If you traveled back in time five years and asked what a futuristic 2018 computer would look like, there’s a pretty good chance that somebody would describe something very much like the Lenovo Yoga Book C930. 
                    It’s a svelte, small, and decently powerful computer that has so many different modes that it’s difficult to call it just one thing, and there’s not much else out there that resembles it in any way.
                    <br><br>
                    It’s not a laptop or a tablet or a note-taking device. 
                    Rather, it’s attempting to be all of those things at once, depending on your needs. 
                    It’s smaller than any Windows computer you’ve likely tried (save maybe the Surface Go), and it has two screens. 
                    One is a traditional LCD touch panel and the other is an E Ink screen that can change its function based on the task. 
                    Sometimes it’s a touch keyboard, and other times, it’s a sketchpad or an e-reader.

                <h2>Samsung updates its Windows VR headset with better display tech</h2>

                <p> 
                    Samsung is refreshing its Windows Mixed Reality headset today with the new HMD Odyssey+. 
                    Samsung’s original headset was one of the best for Windows Mixed Reality, and this refreshed model makes some minor tweaks to improve things. 
                    The headset has the same size dual 3.5-inch AMOLED displays at 1440 x 1600 resolution per eye (with 110-degree field of view), but this time around there’s a wider eye box to prevent fogging and some new display technology.
                    <br><br>
                    Samsung is using Anti-Screen Door Effect (Anti-SDE) tech to improve the pixelation that sometimes occurs with VR headsets. 
                    The technology is designed to make the spaces between pixels less visible, and therefore increasing the perceived PPI up from 616ppi in the previous model to 1,233ppi in the new Odyssey+. 
                    This should help prevent some dizziness or nausea while using this particular VR headset.

                <h2> Why Microsoft should ice its work for America's toxic ICE</h2>

                <p> 
                    Employees are unhappy about the contract with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which has become despised globally as a result of it separating children from their parents at the southern border
                    <br><br>
                    Google got into hot water with employees over working for the US Defence Department – it ended up calling time on the project.
                    <br><br>
                    Now it’s Microsoft’s turn to receive criticism over what it does as part of a contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
                    <br><br>
                    More than 100 employees posted an open letter to the company’s internal message board on Tuesday, protesting about the work and asking for it to be stopped.
                    <br><br>
                    Staff complaints come in the wake of the outrage sparked by the Trump administration’s zero tolerance policy that ICE is central to.
