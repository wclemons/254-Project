                <h2> Ubuntu 19.04 ‚Äì Release Date, Features & More </h2>

                <p>
                    Everything you need to know about the new Ubuntu 19.04 ‚Äì release date, new features, code name, download links, and more. 
                    <br><br>
                    After our posts on Ubuntu 18.04 and 18.10, it‚Äôs time to create a new post about 19.04.
                    <br><br>
                    This release is NOT going to be an LTS release.
                    <br>
                    <h4>Ubuntu 19.04‚Äôs codename is Disco Dingo</h4>
                    Following Ubuntu‚Äôs usual naming standard, the next letter they use is D. 
                    Dingo is a type of dog native to Australia, and we already know what Disco is. 
                    There still hasn‚Äôt been any official statement of what the name actually means. 
                    Interestingly enough, ‚Äúdingo‚Äù is an (outdated) Australian slang term meaning ‚Äúa cowardly or treacherous person‚Äù, though people rarely use it in that context nowadays. 
                    So that alone has left the Ubuntu community coming up with hundreds of interesting meanings behind the name.

                <h2> Changing Up Your Linux Distro </h2>

                <p> 
                    It's common for Linux users to hop between distributions and survey the field, and I recently reached a point where I had to seriously rethink the one I was using most of the time.
                    <br><br>
                    Between hardware compatibility issues with my old standby and some discouraging missteps with other go-to choices, 
                    I felt the time had come to reassess my pool of preferred distributions and repopulate it from scratch.
                    <br><br>
                    As my journey progressed, I realized that as often as I've discussed the field of Linux-based systems, I had not addressed how to pick one out. 
                    To give you an idea of how to approach distribution selection, I wanted to volunteer my recent search as one template. 
                    This is certainly not the only or best way to go about it -- everyone has their own criteria and priorities -- but my intention is to provide some reference points for mapping out your own way.

                <h2> Apple's T2 chip is blocking Linux from booting on new Mac hardware </h2>

                <p> 
                    YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK TWICE before splurging on new Apple hardware as it's been revealed that the firm's T2 security chip is blocking Linux from booting on Mac devices.
                    <br><br>
                    Apple's latest Mac hardware, which includes a new MacBook Air and Mac Mini, comes with the firm's T2 chip embedded, which provides a secure enclave, APFS storage encryption, Touch ID handling, a hardware microphone disconnect on lid close, and other security features.
                    <br><br>
                    However, as reported by Phoronix, the chip also T2 restricts the boot process, and means is that Linux support on Mac hardware is now nonexistent.
                    <br><br>
                    By default, Windows isn't even bootable on Apple's latest hardware until enabling support for Windows via the Boot Camp Assistant on macOS.

                <p> 
                    Linux file-systems continue getting better along with the infrastructure around it in the VFS and block code, but still there are some pain points for both users and developers around Linux storage. 
                    <br><br>
                    Steven French who is a Samba developer and the kernel CIFS VFS maintainer while serving as Microsoft's principal software engineer on Azure storage, presented at last week's Linux Plumbers Conference 2018 on some of the recent file-system/VFS improvements as well as current pain points. 
                    <br><br>
                    Among the work covered is the ongoing development into a new file-system mount API, the new statx syscall for extended stats, new security capabilities, supporting faster storage devices, growing improvements around Linux in the cloud, and other improvements for Linux file-system performance and stability.

                <h2> Overcoming Your Terror of Arch Linux </h2>

                <p> 
                    A recent episode of a Linux news podcast I keep up with featured an interview with a journalist who had written a piece for a non-Linux audience about giving it a try. 
                    It was surprisingly widely read. The writer's experience with some of the more popular desktop distributions had been overwhelmingly positive, and he said as much in his piece and during the subsequent podcast interview.
                    <br><br>
                    However, when the show's host asked whether he had tried Arch Linux -- partly to gauge the depth of his experimentation and partly as a joke -- the journalist immediately and unequivocally dismissed the idea, as if it were obviously preposterous.
                    <br><br>
                    Although that reaction came from an enthusiastic Linux novice, it is one that is not uncommon even among seasoned Linux users. 
                    Hearing it resurface in the podcast got me contemplating why that is -- as I am someone who is comfortable with and deeply respects Arch.

                <h2> Got a Screwdriver? GalliumOS Can Turn Chromebooks Into Linux Boxes </h2>

                <p> 
                    GalliumOS is a Chromebook-specific Linux variant. It lets you put a real Linux distro on a Chromebook.
                    <br><br>
                    My recent review of a new Chromebook feature -- the ability to run Linux apps on some Chromebook models -- sparked my interest in other technologies that run complete Linux distros on some Chromebooks without using ChromeOS.
                    <br><br>
                    GalliumOS is not a perfect solution. 
                    It requires making a physical adjustment inside the hardware and flashing new firmware before the GalliumOS installation ISO will boot. 
                    However, it can be a handy workaround if your Chromebook does not support Linux apps and/or Android apps.

                <h2> Mobile Phone Security: All You Need to Know </h2>

                <p> 
                    We rely on our phones to process and store reams of personal digital data. 
                    Our digital activities -- from checking bank balances to paying for a product with a tap of the screen, to sending friends and family messages over social media, to accessing work emails remotely -- have turned our phones into a goldmine of personal information. 
                    <br><br>
                    It's likely that by 2020, there will be more than 6 billion smartphone users in the world.
                    <br><br>
                    How secure is your mobile device? It's easy to forget that your mobile phone is essentially a pocket-sized computer and that, just as with any device that can connect to the Internet, mobile phones are at risk of a cyberattack.
                    <br><br>
                    The good news is that mobile malware is still relatively uncommon, with the total rate of infections standing at 8 percent. 
                    Mobile malware is outnumbered by PC attacks 40-1, as mobiles operate on far more customized systems, and malware must be tailored to a specific system.

                <h2> Getting Clarity on the Private vs. Public Cloud Decision </h2>

                <p> 
                    News flash: Private cloud economics can offer more cost efficiency than public cloud pricing structures. 
                    <br><br>
                    Private (or on-premises) cloud solutions can be more cost-effective than public cloud options, according to "Busting the Myths of Private Cloud Economics," a report 451 Research and Canonical released Wednesday. That conclusion counters the notion that public cloud platforms traditionally are more cost-efficient than private infrastructures.
                    <br><br>
                    Half of the enterprise IT decision-makers who participated in the study identified cost as the No. 1 pain point associated with the public cloud. 
                    Forty percent mentioned cost-savings as a key driver of cloud migration.
                    <br><br>
                    "We understand that people are looking for more cost-effective infrastructure. 
                    This was not necessarily news to us," said Mark Baker, program director at Canonical.
