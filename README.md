# CPSC 254 - Semester Project - Team WAT
Group members: Aaron Carver, William Clemons, Tu Tran

Our project goal is to create a website that provides summaries of news articles at just a glance. 

Using the SMMRY[https://smmry.com/] API, and RSS subscriptions, we are able to procedurally generate a site that links to the newest and hottest technology news available. Under budget restraints, we are able to call the SMMRY API 100 times per day under their free-to-use partner plan. Additional API calls are available via extra charges. 

Our current design has a few categories and is only specific to certain technology companies or devices, but a similar effect can be achieved with other news categories. 

Future plans include having the site manage itself by sorting through articles on the site, and removing any past a certain time frame or removing the oldest articles when new ones are added. The end goal is to have the website manage itself, and a consumer would be able to receive a daily (or weekly) email containing the recent technology news, with the added short summary. 

The project is meant to provide knowledge and interesting articles to consumers, without the hassle of finding the 100's of websites these articles are posted on. The consumer has the choice of reading just our summary of the article, or can visit the author's article to view the entire text.
