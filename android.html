                <h2> How to Make Any Phone Feel More Like Stock Android (Without Rooting) </h2>

                <p>
                    Now is arguably the best time in the history of the platform for Android users—the OS is getting better, updates are getting (slightly) quicker, and there are several excellent handsetS to choose from. 
                    If you’re not into the whole “manufacturer skin” that most are offering these days, however, it can be slightly less exciting to buy a non-Nexus phone. 
                    But giving your phone a “stock Android” look and feel isn’t as hard as you think.
                    <br><br>
                    If you’re rooted, of course, you could just flash a custom ROM based on stock Android, but most people don’t want to go through that hassle these days. 
                    If you have a Samsung phone, we recommend checking out our Samsung-specific guide–there are a few extra things Samsung has in place that let you make your phone feel like stock. For all other phones, read on.

                <h2> What Data Does Android Back Up Automatically? </h2>

                <p>
                    Much of the data on your Android phone or tablet is backed up by Google (or the individual apps you use) automatically, but what is being saved for you, and what do you need to save for yourself?
                    <br><br>
                    
                    We’ll explain exactly what data is backed up automatically and what isn’t, so you can rest easy knowing your data is safe—or take steps to back up some application data on your own.
                    <h4> What Google Backs Up Automatically </h4>
                    Google has a service built into Android, aptly called Android Backup Service. 
                    By default, this service backs up most types of data you care about and associates it with the appropriate Google service, where you can also access it on the web. 
                    You can see your Sync settings by heading into Settings > Accounts > Google, then selecting your Gmail address.

                <h2> Are Cheap Android Phones Worth It? </h2>

                <p>  
                    Cheap Android phones are quickly becoming commonplace—for as low as $99, you can get a reliable, initially-impressive handset that you’re free to take to a bunch of different carriers. 
                    While these bargain-bin devices are definitely appealing, you have to ask yourself: is it really worth it?
                    <h4> What Makes a Cheap Phone a Cheap Phone? </h4>
                    Let’s start with the obvious: cheap phones are cheaper for a reason. 
                    There has to be something that separates a $99 phone from a $700 one, and–in most cases–it’s probably a few things. 
                    Here are a few areas the manufacturers tend to cut costs.

                <h2> How to Monitor (and Reduce) Your Data Usage on Android </h2>

                <p>  
                    Increasingly sophisticated phones and data-hungry applications make it easier than ever to blow through your cellphone plan’s data cap…and incur nasty overage charges. 
                    Read on as we show you how to manage your data use.
                    <br><br>
                    Just a few short years ago it would have been almost unheard of to blow through multiple GB of mobile data. 
                    Now apps have ballooned in size (it’s not uncommon for apps and their updates to exceed 100MB in size), and with streaming music and video becoming more popular, it’s easy to burn through your data cap in a matter of days.

                <h2> Five Ways to Free Up Space on Your Android Device </h2>

                <p>  
                    Android phones and tablets can fill up quickly as you download apps, add media files like music and movies, and cache data for use offline. 
                    Many lower-end devices may only include a few gigabytes of storage, making this even more of a problem.
                    <br><br>
                    The less space you have, the more time you’ll have to spend micromanaging the internal storage. 
                    If you find yourself regularly running out of space and needing to manage it, consider getting a phone or tablet with more storage next time around.

                <p>  
                    Smartphone cameras have improved dramatically in the last few years, owing to better sensors and smarter image processing. 
                    Heck, the multi-camera revolution has also yielded better zoom and depth-of-field effects hitherto unknown to smartphone photography.
                    <br><br>
                    Nevertheless, having a great camera is only part of the battle. 
                    The rest is up to the photographer holding it, so we take a look at a few smartphone photography tips you should know.

                <p>  
                    Though sales of its devices have been slow, the search giant unveiled the Pixel 3, a smart speaker with a built-in screen and a tablet that doubles as a PC.
                    <br><br>
                    Like its competitors, the Google Pixel 3 has a glass body so that it can be charged wirelessly via magnetic induction.

                    MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — For much of the last decade, Apple and Samsung have dominated sales of smartphones. 
                    So why would anyone bother trying to sell a new phone?

                <h2> Your Smartphone Has a Special Security Chip. Here’s How It Works </h2>

                <p>  
                        Google’s new Pixel 3 phones have a “Titan M” security chip. 
                        Apple has something similar with its “Secure Enclave” on iPhones. 
                        Samsung’s Galaxy phones and other Android phones often use ARM’s TrustZone technology. 
                        Here’s how they help protect your phone.

                        <h4> The Basics </h4>
                        These chips are basically separate little computers inside your phone. 
                        They have different processors and memory, and they run their own tiny operating systems.
                        <br><br>
                        Your phone’s regular operating system and the applications running on it can’t see inside the secure area. 
                        This protects the secure area from tampering and lets the secure area do a variety of useful things.
